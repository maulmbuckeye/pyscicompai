## Formula

Written as a system of four first order ordinary diffferential equations (ODEs):

$$ \dot x_1 = y_1 $$

$$ \dot y_1 = -\dfrac{1}{m_1}(k_1 x_1 + k_2 (x_1 - x_2)) $$

$$ \dot x_2 = y_2 $$

$$ \dot y_2 = -\dfrac{1}{m_2}(k_2 (x_2 - x_1) + k_3 x_2)) $$

where $\dot y_1 = \ddot x_1$ and $\dot y_2 = \ddot x_2$.
